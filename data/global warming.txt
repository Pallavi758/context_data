1. **What is global warming?**
   - Answer: Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature primarily due to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. It is a result of the enhanced greenhouse effect, where greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere.

2. **What causes global warming?**
   - Answer: Global warming is primarily caused by the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases are released through human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural practices.

3. **How does global warming affect the planet?**
   - Answer: Global warming has various impacts on the planet, including rising temperatures, melting ice caps and glaciers, sea-level rise, extreme weather events (such as hurricanes and heatwaves), shifts in ecosystems and biodiversity, and disruptions to agriculture and water resources.

4. **Is global warming the same as climate change?**
   - Answer: No, global warming and climate change are related but distinct concepts. Global warming refers specifically to the increase in Earth's surface temperature. Climate change encompasses a broader range of changes, including shifts in temperature patterns, precipitation, wind patterns, and other long-term alterations in Earth's climate system.

5. **Are humans responsible for global warming?**
   - Answer: Yes, human activities are the primary drivers of global warming. The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes releases large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Deforestation and land-use changes also contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions.

6. **How can we mitigate global warming?**
   - Answer: Mitigating global warming requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. This includes adopting renewable energy technologies, improving energy efficiency, promoting sustainable land-use practices, and implementing policies to limit emissions.

7. **What are the consequences of not addressing global warming?**
   - Answer: Failing to address global warming can lead to severe consequences. These include more frequent and intense heatwaves, rising sea levels that threaten coastal communities, disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity, reduced agricultural productivity, increased water scarcity, and heightened risks to human health and well-being.

8. **Can individuals make a difference in combating global warming?**
   - Answer: Yes, individuals can contribute to the fight against global warming through small lifestyle changes and choices. This includes conserving energy, reducing personal carbon footprints by using public transportation or carpooling, practicing energy-efficient habits at home, supporting renewable energy initiatives, and advocating for sustainable policies.

9. **What is the role of governments and international cooperation in addressing global warming?**
   - Answer: Governments play a crucial role in implementing policies and regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote renewable energy adoption, and encourage sustainable practices. International cooperation, such as the Paris Agreement, helps coordinate global efforts to tackle climate change and establish emission reduction targets.

10. **How can we adapt to the impacts of global warming?**
    - Answer: Adaptation to the impacts of global warming involves preparing for and minimizing the risks associated with climate change. This includes investing in resilient infrastructure, developing early warning systems for extreme weather events, implementing sustainable water management practices, and supporting vulnerable communities in adapting to changing conditions.
